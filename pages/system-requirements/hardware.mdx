# Hardware Requirements

As mentioned earlier, ravynOS should be capable to run on most modern hardware from ~2012, here's the requirements:

 * UEFI boot
 * 4 GB of RAM
 * 64-bit 2 GHz dual-core Intel or AMD (4+ cores)
 * Intel IRIS, Nvidia, or AMD Radeon (GPUs compatible with FreeBSD and X.Org)
 * PS2 & USB Devices (I2C devices may not work)
 * Wired or wireless network controllers compatible with FreeBSD-Current

To check individual components, see here on the [FreeBSD hardware support list](https://www.freebsd.org/releases/12.0R/hardware/)
