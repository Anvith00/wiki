# Virtualization Setup

Virtualization is efficient for developers to develop and design graphical applications without the need to install RavynOS on hardware.

Below are steps on how to setup a virtualized environment for RavynOS to run in.


## Preparing

Make sure you have downloaded our ISO, ready to setup your virtualized environment. You can find our mirror list [here](/download/mirror-list) to download an ISO.

## Setting Up

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  These steps are for Qemu/KVM for use with virsh/virt-manager (tested with v0.3.0)
</Callout>

 * Create a new virtual machine
 * Select FreeBSD as the OS
 * Choose the RavynOS ISO as the install media
 * Create 20GB in storage

<Callout type="error" emoji="🚫">
  Before finishing setup, click on "advanced configuration" and make sure to select UEFI instead of BIOS and select i440FX-Chipset (if you use Q35-chipset, virtual graphics tablet driver - as a mouse replacement - might not work)
</Callout>

 * Finish setup
 * Don't start the Virtual Machine yet, first you must set the boot option CD-ROM to SATA-type
 * Set Harddisk to virtio-type
 * Activate boot menu, and change the boot order to boot from CD first (after installation, change this setting back)
 * Set Video to VGA instead of QXL
 * In order to have a "free mouse", you can choose to add "EvTouch USB graphics tabler" --> with booted Desktop, your mouse should 'escape' the vm easily.

In the TianoCore UEFI (enter this with the ESC key), it may be helpful to change the preferred screen resolution via Device Manager > OVMF Platform Configuration to something greater than 1024x78
