# Virtualization Setup

Virtualization is efficient for developers to develop and design graphical applications without the need to install ravynOS on hardware.

Below are steps on how to setup a virtualized environment for ravynOS to run in.


## Preparing

Make sure you have downloaded our ISO, ready to setup your virtualized environment. You can find our mirror list [here](/download/mirror-list) to download an ISO.

## Setting Up

  These steps are for Qemu/KVM for use with virsh/virt-manager (tested with v0.3.0)
</Callout>
<Steps>
### Create a new virtual machine
### Select FreeBSD as the Operating System
### Choose the ravynOS ISO as the install media
### Create 20GB in Hard Drive Storage

  Before finishing setup, click on "advanced configuration" and make sure to select UEFI instead of BIOS and select i440FX-Chipset (if you use Q35-chipset, virtual graphics tablet driver - as a mouse replacement - might not work)
</Callout>
### Finish setup
### Set the Boot Option CD-ROM to SATA-type
### Set Hard Disk to virtio-type
### Activate boot menu
### Change the boot order to boot from CD first
After the installation of ravynOS, you can change this setting back.
### Set Video to VGA 
Instead of the QXL Option selected by default.
