# Developer Environment Setup

Developing for ravynOS requires a running ravynOS system to build on. Please make sure your hardware meets the [Hardware Requirements](/hardware).

## Installing from the Live USB (or CD)

This will result in a full ravynOS system including the default apps. There is a new AppKit-based installer available since Tanuki 0.3.0, `Install ravynOS.app`. The legacy `Install FreeBSD.app` is also still present as a backup. It will be removed once the new installer is more hardened.

`Install FreeBSD.app` has some problems and may not work for you. The best environment seems to be a non-UEFI system ('Legacy' boot) and SATA disk, which breaks the ravynOS requirement for UEFI. It will also create different ZFS pools and may not upgrade cleanly to future releases.

## Miscellaneous

Once you have the system installed, you'll need a few essentials. Most of what you need will be pre-installed but check out the ravynOS package repo for extra tools with `pkg search` and `pkg install`.

For code editing, the default tool is `/Applications/Kate.app`. It's not exactly Xcode but it's pretty good and has nice color schemes. A reasonable `Terminal.app` can be found in `/Applications/Utilities` and Firefox is pre-installed in `/Applications`.

ravynOS builds most things with Unix Makefiles. See the source repos for some examples. In particular, the include fragments `ravynOS.app.mk` and `ravynOS.framework.mk` are available to help build App and Framework Bundles respectively. CMake also knows how to build App Bundles and [Makefiles](https://github.com/ravynsoft/Kate_app/blob/main/Makefile) can be convinced to build a MacOS bundle and Info.plist (on ravynOS) which is then easily converted to an ravynOS bundle.

If you have a Mac, Xcode can be used to build the UI for Objective-C AppKit apps. Compile the project, locate the *.nib files it produces (not the *.xib in your source tree!) and copy those to ravynOS along with the source code. It may just build & run but you will likely have to tweak a few selectors or some `retain` or `autorelease` calls. ravynOS's AppKit and Foundation trail behind the latest available APIs.

Another option is to use plain C or C++ with CoreFoundation, CoreGraphics, etc or with Qt 5. Java SDK 17 is also available in `/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines`.
