## Mirroring ravynOS

If you wish to mirror ravynOS, send us a message and we will help you get setup and added to our official mirror list. We recommend syncing from our primary mirror sites at-least once every 24 hours as we do nightly builds. We recommend at-least 100 gigabytes of storage space to dedicate to the project and a connection speed of at-least 100 megabit/s.

The following script can be used for your initial sync from our primary mirror sites please choose the site closet to you connection wise.

```sh
rsync -avz --delete --safe-links rsync://mirrors.nomadlogic.org/www/ <target>

rsync -avz --delete --safe-links rsync://mirror2.sandyriver.net/pub/ravynos/ <target>
```
