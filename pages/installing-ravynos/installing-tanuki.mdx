# Installing Tanuki

* Boot the Live ISO
* Open Filer and navigate to <code>/Applications/Utilities</code>
* Double-click on <code>Install AiryxOS.app</code>

The installer will walk you through the installation process. Note that this version requires a whole disk and is not compatible with dual-boot systems. It is best tried in a virtual machine.
